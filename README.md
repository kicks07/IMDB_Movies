## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using IMDB data from 2021 to better understand:

1. The relationship between movie budgets and consumer reception.
2. The relationship between movie budgets and profitability.
3. The relationship between movie reception and profitabilty.

The full set of files used can be found within this GIT repository.
